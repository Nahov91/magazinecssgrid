# magazinecssgrid
Magazine frontpage layout built with CSS gird

##What is this
This project contains html, css and some images to create a magazine-like layout.

##What is it for
I wanted to explore the world of CSS Grid, because that is the future. CSS grid is the latest CSS grid system, which is even more advanced then the flexbox system. Here we are working with 2D grids instead of 1D grids.

##How to use it
You can clone the repo or download the zip file to get all the files that are necessary. You can open it with _index.html_
